We have obtained constraints on the nanoflare energy distribution and timing for the heating of a coronal bright point. Observations of the bright point were made using the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on Hinode in slot mode, which collects a time series of monochromatic images of the region leading to unambiguous temperature diagnostics. The Enthalpy-Based Thermal Evolution of Loops model was used to simulate nanoflare heating of the bright point and generate a time series of synthetic intensities. The nanoflare heating in the model was parameterized in terms of the power-law index α of the nanoflare energy distribution, which is∝ E− α; average nanoflare frequency f; and the number N of magnetic strands making up the observed loop. By comparing the synthetic and observed light curves, we inferred the region of the model parameter space (α, f, N) that was consistent with the observations …

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
