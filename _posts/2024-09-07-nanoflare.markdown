We have obtained constraints on the nanoflare energy distribution and timing for the heating of a coronal bright point. Observations of the bright point were made using the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on Hinode in slot mode, which collects a time series of monochromatic images of the region leading to unambiguous temperature diagnostics. The Enthalpy-Based Thermal Evolution of Loops model was used to simulate nanoflare heating of the bright point and generate a time series of synthetic intensities. The nanoflare heating in the model was parameterized in terms of the power-law index α of the nanoflare energy distribution, which is∝ E− α; average nanoflare frequency f; and the number N of magnetic strands making up the observed loop. By comparing the synthetic and observed light curves, we inferred the region of the model parameter space (α, f, N) that was consistent with the observations …
